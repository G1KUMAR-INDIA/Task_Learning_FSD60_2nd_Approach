The document and window objects are essential components of the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) and the global scope, respectively. 
They serve distinct purposes and provide different functionalities.

Window Object:
    The window object represents the browser window or frame in which the web page is displayed. 
It is the global object in client-side JavaScript, meaning all global variables, functions, and objects are properties of the window object. 
Here are some key characteristics and functionalities of the window object:
Global Scope: 
    Any variable or function declared in the global scope becomes a property of the window object. 
    For instance, var x = 10; is equivalent to window.x = 10;.
Browser Control: 
    The window object provides methods to control the browser window, 
    such as window.open() to open a new browser window, window.close() to close the current window, and window.resizeTo() to resize the window.
Event Handling: 
    It allows for the handling of global events like window.onload (which triggers when the page has finished loading) and window.onresize 
    (which triggers when the window is resized).

Timers: 
    The window object includes methods for setting timers, such as window.setTimeout() and window.setInterval(), 
    which are used to execute code after a specified delay or at regular intervals, respectively.

Alerting: 
    Methods like window.alert(), window.confirm(), and window.prompt() are used to display alert boxes and dialogs to the user.
Document Object
    The document object, on the other hand, represents the HTML document loaded in the window. 
    It is a property of the window object, accessible via window.document (often simply document). 
    The document object provides a gateway to the content of the web page and allows for dynamic manipulation of the page. 
    Key features and functionalities of the document object include:
DOM Manipulation: 
    The document object is used to access and manipulate the HTML structure. 
    Methods like document.getElementById(), document.querySelector(), and document.createElement() allow for the selection, creation, and modification of HTML elements.

Content Access: 
    It provides properties to access various parts of the document, such as document.title (to get or set the title of the document), document.body (to access the body element), and document.forms (to access the forms within the document).

Event Handling: 
    The document object allows attaching event listeners to elements within the DOM, enabling interaction with the user. 
    For example, document.addEventListener('click', function), adds a click event listener to the entire document.

Document Metadata: 
    It allows access to the metadata of the document, such as document.URL (the URL of the document), document.referrer (the URL of the previous document that linked to this one), and document.cookie (to get or set cookies).

Loading State: 
    The document object has properties like document.readyState which indicates the loading state of the document, useful for executing code when the document is fully loaded.

Summary
    The window object is the global scope of the browser, managing the browser window and providing methods to control it.
    The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the window, allowing access to and manipulation of the page content.
    Understanding the difference between these two objects is fundamental for effectively manipulating web pages and creating dynamic user experiences.
