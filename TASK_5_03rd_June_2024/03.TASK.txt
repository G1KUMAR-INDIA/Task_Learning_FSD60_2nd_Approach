Difference between window, screen and document in Java Script
In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are global objects that represent different parts of the browser environment. 
Each serves a distinct purpose:

1. window:
The window object represents the browser window or tab containing a web page. It is the global object in the browser environment, meaning that all global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

Key properties and methods:

i)window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight: The width and height of the window's content area (viewport).
ii)window.alert(): Displays an alert dialog.
iii)window.location: Represents the current URL and can be used to navigate to a different page.
iv)window.setTimeout(): Calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

2. screen:
The screen object provides information about the user's screen, such as its width, height, and color depth. 
This object is not used as frequently as window or document, but it can be useful for responsive design and multimedia applications.

Key properties:

i)screen.width and screen.height: The width and height of the user's screen in pixels.
ii)screen.availWidth and screen.availHeight: The width and height of the screen, excluding operating system features like the taskbar.
iii)screen.colorDepth: The number of bits used to display one color.

3. document
The document object represents the HTML or XML document loaded in the browser window. 
It provides methods and properties to interact with and manipulate the content of the web page.

Key properties and methods:

i)document.getElementById(): Returns an element with a specified ID.
ii)document.querySelector(): Returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
iii)document.createElement(): Creates a new element.
iv)document.body: Represents the <body> element of the document.
v)document.title: Gets or sets the title of the document.
Summary
window: Represents the browser window or tab and provides methods and properties for controlling it.
screen: Provides information about the user's screen, such as dimensions and color depth.
document: Represents the web page's content and provides methods and properties for interacting with it.
Each of these objects serves a different role in web development, allowing you to interact with and manipulate various aspects of the user's browsing experience.
